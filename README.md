# animating-svg-css
This project was made for Medellín CSS community workshop called "Animando SVG con CSS"

## Steps
* Clone the project.
* When working on an exercise you have to copy the content inside the SVG file and paste it inside the `body` tag.
* Modify all the id's as you please.
* Start making magic and having fun on `styles.css` file :3

### Second exercise
We have a pretty nice illustration, the idea is to animate all the illustration with a chill vibe :3

### Music
