# animating-svg-css
This project was made for Medellín CSS community workshop called "Animando SVG con CSS"

## Steps
* Clone the project.
* When working on an exercise you have to copy the content inside the SVG file and paste it inside the `body` tag.
* Modify all the id's as you place.
* Start making magic and having fun on `styles.css` file :3

### First exercise
The idea is to animate the phrase by animating a heart beat and the letters.

### Second exercise
We have a pretty nice illustration, the idea is to animate all the illustration with a chill vibe :3

### Group exercise
We will have fun together, you will have a randomly generated team.  
You will have to work in the `group-option-#` where `#` will be given to you and your team.  
When you know the number, the steps are the same.  
The idea is to create an animation for the logo, blow up your imagination and show us your team's creation.  
Remember this is not a contest, just enjoy and apply what you learnt.
